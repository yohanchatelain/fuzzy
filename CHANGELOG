# [v0.8.0] 2022/07/15

## Changed
    * Change mecanisme to introduce noise in libmath. Now it uses a direct call to the inexact function, allowing to perturb libmath results within RR mode.
    * Change verificarlo version to compile fuzzy images [v0.6.0 -> v0.7.0]
## Fixed
    * l_gammaf_r test that failed due to uninitialized pointer value

# [v0.6.0] 2022/01/07

## Changed
    * Change verificarlo version to compile fuzzy images [v0.5.0 -> v0.6.0]
    * Change base3 sklearn version [v0.23.2 -> v1.0.2]
    * Change base2 scipy version [v1.5.4 -> v1.7.3]
    * Change base1 numpy version [v1.19.1 -> v1.22.0]

## Fixed
    * Fix issue due to hardware specific instruction (AVX)
    * Can be run on any x86_64 architecture now

## Deprecated
    * Version v0.5.0 must not be used on architecture not supporting AVX-512
# [v0.5.0] 2021/06/18

## Changed
    * Changed verificarlo version to compile fuzzy images [v0.4.1 -> v0.5.0]

## Deprecated
    * Version v0.4.1 should not be used anymore because it contains a bug
    on vectorized instructions.

# [v0.4.1] 2021/06/18

## Added
    * Add build script to wrap an existing docker image with the fuzzy-libmath
    * Add dockerfile for base3 + sklearn:0.23.2 (base 4)
    * Add dockerfile for base2 + scipy:1.5.4 (base 3)
    * Add dockerfile for base1 + numpy:1.19.1 (base 2)
    * Add dockerfile for base0 + python:3.8.5 (base 1)
    * Add dockerfile for fuzzy lapack:3.9.0 + libmath (base 0)
    * Add fuzzy libmath project from https://github.com/big-data-lab-team/MCA-libmath
